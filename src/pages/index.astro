      <p>My name's Galen, and this is my (work in progress) personal site.</p>
      <p>
        I currently work as a <a href="https://ccv.brown.edu"
          >Research Software Engineer</a
        > at Brown University. I graduated from there in Fall 2023 after
        completing a Bachelor of Arts in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong
          >Environmental Studies</strong
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about writing software that makes the world a better
        place, spending time outdoors with loved ones, and playing music with
        and for others.

        As you can see, this site has a minimalist design; it's meant for
        sharing what I'm doing and have done with as little distraction as
        possible. I think most websites should be like this: informative,
        accessible, and cleanly designed.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, I'll add links to past web projects to show off what I can do
        ðŸ˜‰.
