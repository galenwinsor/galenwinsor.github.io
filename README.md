# Galen's Web Projects
Below are links to my web development projects, including two from my work on Jaime Harrison's Senate campaign. 

## Jaime Harrison for U.S. Senate

- [Pledge to vote for Jaime](https://galenwinsor.com/pledge-to-vote): the page collects and stores data on likely voters in South Carolina and records them in Blue State Digital and NGP VAN. The page then generates a pledge-to-vote graphic for social media, filled in with the user's responses, using an app I built with the Fabric.js framework. 
- [Endorsement generator](https://galenwinsor.com/graphic-maker): a graphic-generator that allows Jaime supporters to generate their own comic book-style endorsement. The page uses a different version of the graphic-generator app that powers the pledge-to-vote page. 

## Other

- [Willow](https://galenwinsor.com/willow): a website that consolidates resources for coping with loss during COVID-19.
