# Galen's Web Projects

Hi! I'm Galen and I'm currently a Research Software Engineer at Brown University's [Center for Computation and Visualization](https://ccv.brown.edu/) where I build web and mobile applications for researchers. This site is quite out of date, and I'm hard at work on a new and improved site with many more of my projects.

For now, check out the following, very limited selection of my projects. With the exception of "How Do They Lobby", I built all these projects very early in my software engineering journey using only vanilla web technologies and `jQuery`, and I'm proud of what I was able to create with such limited tools. Nowadays, I build with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, accessibility libraries like RadixUI, and fullstack frameworks like SvelteKit and NextJS. Stay tuned for examples!

## Brown University Climate and Development Lab

- [How Do They Lobby](https://howdotheylobby.org/): a website for visualizing and exploring the CDL's novel dataset of lobbying positions in states across the U.S. I built this site using SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS, and a Postgres database hosted through Supabase. The dataset underlying the site has over 14 million records, which made for a fun challenge in fetching data efficiently. I'm particularly proud of the fact that the entire UI, including the visualizations, is built from scratch using Tailwind, vanilla SVG, and a sprinkling of D3.js.

## Jaime Harrison for U.S. Senate

- [Pledge to vote for Jaime](https://galenwinsor.com/pledge-to-vote): the page collects and stores data on likely voters in South Carolina and records them in Blue State Digital and NGP VAN. The page then generates a pledge-to-vote graphic for social media, filled in with the user's responses, using an app I built with the Fabric.js framework. 
- [Endorsement generator](https://galenwinsor.com/graphic-maker): a graphic-generator that allows Jaime supporters to generate their own comic book-style endorsement. The page uses a different version of the graphic-generator app that powers the pledge-to-vote page. 

## Other

- [Willow](https://galenwinsor.com/willow): a website that consolidates resources for coping with loss during COVID-19.
